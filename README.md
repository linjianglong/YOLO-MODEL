The impact of floating debris in rivers on water environments has become increasingly severe with rapid urbanization and industrialization. To address the challenges of low detection accuracy and high false-negative rates in existing methods, especially under complex water surface backgrounds and multi-scale object recognition, this study proposes an enhanced river floating debris detection algorithm based on YOLOv8n. We integrate an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism into the C2f module to enhance object recognition in complex backgrounds. A Deep Cross-scale Feature Fusion (DCWF) module is designed to improve the model's adaptability to scale variations. An Inner Intersection over Union (Inner-IoU) loss function, based on auxiliary bounding boxes, is introduced to optimize bounding box regression and enhance localization accuracy. A diversified floating debris dataset, encompassing various environments and water surface conditions, is constructed to bolster the model's generalization ability.These enhancements significantly improve detection performance, offering new insights into the development of intelligent river waste monitoring technology.

If you want to train the model, add the EMA attention mechanism, the DCWF module, and the Inner-iou module to the YOLOv8n benchmark model for training
